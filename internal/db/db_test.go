// TestListCardsByEntityIsOldestLinkFirst pins the order of the session→cards
// reverse lookup.
//
// The order is part of the answer. One session picks up a dispatch card and
// then has its work classified onto more, and a caller that must name a
// single card — "which todo is this session for?" — reads the first one. The
// honest answer is the link that was made before the session did anything.
//
// The GROUP BY in the query is the SELECT DISTINCT it replaced, kept so the
// dedupe survives if the UNIQUE (card_id, entity_type, entity_ref) index ever
// relaxes. It has nothing to dedupe today, which is why there is no test for
// it: that state is unreachable through both the API and the schema.
//
// This has to insert rows directly, because through the public API a link's
// created_at is stamped at insert time and therefore always agrees with the
// order rows were written in. That agreement is what hides the defect: an
// unordered SELECT returns rows in whatever order SQLite finds convenient,
// which today happens to match and stops matching the moment the planner
// picks an index. Writing created_at out of step with insertion order is the
// only way to ask which of the two the query is actually promising.
