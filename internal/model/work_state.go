// WorkState is where a piece of work stands, in words every board shares.
//
// Boards are views, not containers: one card can sit on several boards, and
// each board names its columns its own way ("Waiting on reply", "Blocked").
// A column's work_state maps its name onto this one vocabulary, so a reader
// that spans boards — a project rollup, an orchestrator counting what is
// waiting on someone — can count cards without knowing any board's names.
//
// It is separate from auto_status on purpose. auto_status writes noteboard's
// open/done/archived onto the item when a card lands in the column; work_state
// writes nothing anywhere and is only read. A `done` or `dropped` work_state
// does not imply any auto_status, and setting one never sets the other: doing
// so would make classifying a column silently start editing noteboard items.
// A column that should also close its todos sets both.
