"""Score internal/api's hold-gate tests by breaking the API on purpose.

    python3 scripts/sabotage-hold-gate.py [--diffs]

A passing suite is not evidence. These tests were written because `holdCard(w, r,
cardID, hold bool)` had never been called by any test: POST /cards/{id}/hold and
POST /cards/{id}/unhold reach that one function and are told apart by that one
argument, so nothing pinned which of the two a request actually performed.

What the gap costs is specific. noteboard withholds held items from the agent
read paths, so a hold is how the user parks work an unattended agent must not
pick up. An inverted gate does not fail loudly — pressing hold clears the hold,
and the next unattended pass sees the card as ordinary open work.

Two columns, and the difference between them is the point:

  MINE      only the hold-gate tests in internal/api/hold_gate_test.go
  PRIOR     the rest of ./internal/api/, with that file taken away entirely

MINE answers "did the tests I wrote catch this?". PRIOR answers the question
that decides whether they were worth writing: "would this have been caught
anyway?". PRIOR is measured by moving the file out of the package, not with a
`-run` filter: the unfiltered package CONTAINS the new tests, so it reddens
whenever MINE does and the comparison would report "necessary" for every row by
construction.

Case-writing rules, inherited from the fleet's other scorers:

  - Prefer a DRIFTED VALUE to a deletion: it orphans no identifier and is the
    likelier real regression. `go test` runs vet, so an edit that fails to
    compile reports a build error instead of a score.
  - Two controls, not one. Only a cry-wolf control and everything reports
    CAUGHT; only a known-negative and you cannot tell a working suite from a
    harness that never runs the tests.
  - Every needle is asserted to occur exactly once before the run. A needle that
    matches nothing is indistinguishable from a surviving mutation, and zero
    matches is green.

⚠️ Region this scorer does NOT cover, declared rather than left to be
rediscovered: noteboard's own hold semantics (this suite drives a fake), the
roll-up of a hold over parent_id, the spend ceiling, and every other card route.
