"""Create the boards the Northwind demo runs on.

This sets up EMPTY boards and nothing else: columns, the priority ladder, and
the working week. It used to create nine hand-written cards as well, and those
cards were the problem. They were written before the repository existed in its
current shape, and one of them asked for a Node build image to be bumped in a
Go service that has never contained a line of JavaScript. A real agent picked
it up, checked every branch and all twelve commits, refused, and wrote down
why — behaving exactly as instructed, at the cost of a real session.

Cards now arrive the way they will in use: `demo-mail-generator` writes work
mail about the actual repository, and `email-classifier -vocabulary work` files
that mail onto the board. Nothing here invents work.

Two boards, because they answer different questions about the same cards:

  Work board      the EMAIL view — what arrived and whether it needs a person.
                  Its columns are the ones email-classifier looks up by name.
  Northwind work  the AGENT view — queued, running, done. Its columns are the
                  ones kanban-curator requires by name, so closing a card is
                  done by the tool that already does it.

A card sits on both. Same noteboard item, two placements, so closing it in one
closes it in the other.

    ./scripts/seed_work_board.py           # create whatever is missing
    ./scripts/seed_work_board.py --purge   # hard-delete the cards and the boards
